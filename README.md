# JoinUp - CPAN144 Group Project (Phase 2)

## Project Overview
**Local Loop (JoinUp)** is a community web platform that helps users discover and share neighborhood events like garage sales, workshops, art fairs, and pop-up markets. Our mission is to solve the visibility problem for small-scale local events by providing a centralized platform for event discovery and participation.

## Implemented Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dynamic Event Pages** | Next.js dynamic routes (`/events/[id]`) for detailed event views |
| **Responsive Layout** | Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS |
| **Global State Management** | Context API for shared event/filter state |
| **Component Library** | Reusable UI components (EventCard, FilterBar, Layout, Navbar) |
| **Authentication System** | Customer login & logout using a custom `AuthContext` |
| **Sign-Up Feature** | Users can create their own accounts directly from the home page |
| **Event Management** | Logged-in users can add and delete event cards; logged-out users can still view events |
| **Test Account Access** | Pre-set credentials for quick exploration without sign-up |
| **User-Friendly Navigation** | Persistent navbar, home-page CTAs, and "Back to Home" button on login page |
| **Hero & Feature Sections** | Engaging home page with clear descriptions of platform benefits |
